*This post is related to my article [The issue of null](https://ppixel.me/blog/2023/07/16/The-issue-of-null.html) ([mirror](https://github.com/peacefulpixel/articles/blob/main/articles/the-issue-of-null/article.md)).*

People still doubt that Java's ``Optional`` could be used effectively, and I understand them. Honestly, I was one of them, before I figured the power of ``.map()``&``.flatMap()`` methods. I want to describe a case that I got today, and also want **you**, reader, to try asscociating that with your cases.

*All the code is simplified for understanding (I removed obvious logic like `try/catch` blocks and keywords like `private`)*

## What we had

A JavaFX application, that have the following architecture for resource management:

```java
abstract class Resource<T> {
    T lazyVal = null;

    abstract String getRelativePath();
    abstract T build(URL url);
    
    public T get() {
        return askFor().orElseThrow();
    }

    public Optional<T> askFor() {

        if (lazyVal == null) {
            final URL url = Resource.class
                    .getResource("/com/example/" + getRelativePath());

            if (url != null)
                lazyVal = build(url);
        }

        return lazyVal == null ? Optional.empty() : Optional.of(lazyVal);
    }
}
```

And we got multiple implementations like ``CSSResource``, ``FXMLResource`` and ``ImageResource`` for instance. Each of those implements ``getRelativePath()`` and ``build(URL url)`` for the specific type ``T`` which is a ``javafx.scene.image.Image`` for ``ImageResource`` for example.

So the thing is that ``ImageResource`` produce an image by ``Image build(URL url)``, that's it.

## What we gotta do

JavaFX has a common issue with a system tray. In short words - it requires to use an AWT like the Swing does. Honestly I don't know why, because i'm coding at Java 17 and using latest JFX, but the system tray still not implemented. The team planning to use native solution in future, but now we need to have a prototype, which should be codded on nearest possible solution - which is unfortunetly an AWT.

To instantate a tray menu in AWT we have to create a ``new TrayIcon(image)`` instance, where image is ``Image``, but not a `javafx.scene.image.Image`. Yep, it's another image class, that is from AWT and they both, obviously have no any compatibility ðŸ™„

Now, our ``ImageResource`` should temporary be a resource for ``java.awt.Image`` and ``javafx.scene.image.Image`` both, to have decent code which might be still even in release version.

## The result

Solution I see is to add ``askForAWTImage()`` method into a ``ImageResource``, but I really don't wanna copy resource retreiving logic, evetually because it contains classpath that I don't want to exlude in constant, because, by design, the only method should be dependent on it.

So we move actual resource retrieving logic to separate method:

```java
protected URL getResource() {
    return Resource.class.getResource("/com/example/" + getRelativePath());
}
```

And here, the URL could be a ``null``, if resource doesn't exists and also, the only dependent code on it yet, does the nullity check, so semantically - that ``URL`` is optional. Well, I wrap it:

```java
protected Optional<URL> getResource() {
    return Optional.ofNullable(Resource.class.getResource(
            "/com/example/" + getRelativePath()));
}
```

Then I going to ``askFor()`` method and realize that it so dumb, so I just use a single ``flatMap()`` to simplify it:

```java
public final Optional<T> askFor() {
    return getResource().flatMap(url -> 
            Optional.ofNullable(lazyVal = build(url)));
}
```

Well, that's it. Just a reminder that previous version was:

```java
public final Optional<T> askFor() {
    if (lazyVal == null) {
        final URL url = Resource.class.getResource("/com/example/" + getRelativePath());
        if (url != null)
            lazyVal = buildFromURL(url);
    }

    return lazyVal == null ? Optional.empty() : Optional.of(lazyVal);
}
```

## Conclusion

Comparing previous and current solutions I can't find the following benifits:

- Decreased nesting (+readability, +supportrability)

- Decreased code amount (+readability)

- Two simple methods instead of one combined (+flexibility)

My target was to improve flexibility for ``ImageResource`` implementation and, I guess, If found most elegant way to reach it.
