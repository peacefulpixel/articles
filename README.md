# Articles of ppixel.me
All the original articles are deployed in [my blog](https://ppixel.me/blog)

*P.S. I don't wanna use GitHub pages, because this repo is needed to track changes related only to articles by themselves, no any other content. Also they most likely will be translated to other languages and published on other resources, but the articles sources will still being here*
